              Around 74 per cent of natural disasters between 2001 and 2018 were
              water-related, including droughts and floods. The frequency and
              intensity of such events are only expected to increase with
              climate change.

              Around 450 million children live in areas of high or extremely
              high water vulnerability. This means they do not have enough water
              to meet their everyday needs.

              The effects of climate change are first felt through water â€“
              through droughts, floods or storms. When these disasters hit, they
              can wipe out entire water supplies or leave them contaminated,
              risking the lives of millions of children.
